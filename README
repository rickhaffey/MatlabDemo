Repository for storing both the Matlab script and function files,
as well as the actual demo content files, for a basic Matlab demo.

Based on a couple of other demos similar demos.  Tries to follow
a pattern similar to the demo or tutorial built into emacs, where the
flow of the tutorial is controlled using elisp, and the tutorial user
has some level of control of the steps viewed.
