Our first real work in Matlab will be with scalars.  These are discrete
values 

    >> N = 5

Matlab will accept the input, and then display the result of the evaluation.

If you follow the assignment with a semicolon ';', Matlab will still accept
and evaluate the result, but will not display the result back to the command
window:

    >> N = 5;

Try it now before moving to the next step.
